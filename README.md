The project aims to identify fake or manipulated images by leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a popular deep learning technique for image analysis. Implemented in Python, the project utilizes TensorFlow, a robust deep learning library, to build, train, and evaluate the CNN model. The dataset is categorized into original and manipulated images.   

To enhance the detection process, the images undergo preprocessing using advanced techniques such as Error Level Analysis (ELA), Noise Analysis, and Gradient Analysis. These methods highlight inconsistencies in image characteristics, making it easier for the model to differentiate between authentic and fake images. Additionally, image augmentation techniques introduce variations like rotation, flipping, and scaling, ensuring a diverse and robust training process while preventing overfitting.

The CNN model is constructed with multiple layers, including convolutional layers for feature extraction, batch normalization for stabilizing training, and dropout layers to reduce overfitting. The inclusion of a confusion matrix further evaluates the performance, providing insights into classification accuracy.
